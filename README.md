The binaries are compiled for x64 ArchLinux using GCC. To compile them on your own Linux system you can use

```bash
$ gcc <file.c> -o <file> -lm
```

and replace `<file.c>` and `<file>` with the name of the file containing the code. 


You can then run the code with 
```bash
./<file>
```


The .nb files are Mathematica notebook files that I used to check my calculations and for plots. 

ANSWERS.pdf contains the compiled LaTeX code for the assignment corresponding to the parent directory.
